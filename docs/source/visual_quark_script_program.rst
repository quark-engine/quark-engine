Introducing Our Plan to Develop a Visual Programming Tool for Quark Scripts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quark scripts are a powerful tool for detecting and analyzing mobile security. However, they can be complex and challenging for users who are not familiar with programming. To overcome this challenge, we are pleased to announce our plan to develop a visual programming tool that simplifies the Quark script organization process, making it easy for anyone to organize Quark scripts using a simple UI interface.


What Goals Do We Want To Achieve?
=================================

Our goal is to make Quark script programming accessible to everyone and remove the barriers that often come with traditional programming languages. We believe that by providing a visual tool to organize Quark scripts, we can significantly reduce the time and effort required to write complex scripts while also making it more intuitive for users who are not familiar with programming.

Roadmap
=======

The following table is the roadmap for this product. We are still in the early development stage, and the first phase is mainly focused on completing the main functions to enable users to operate the system intuitively, view Quark script diagrams, and assemble new Quark scripts on their own.
